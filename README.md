ModelCG--
=========

Simple reference codebase for a UML-like modeler and code generator. 
It is not meant to be a production-maintained tool. Hence, the decrementer in the title '--'. 
If you want a good UML tool to use, there a plenty out there.


Features
- Integration with Groovy as a command line for model manipulation
- DraggableCanvas framework as a basis for the UML GUI
- code generator based on JAX-B annotations
- Compliance to OMG UML Infrastructure 2.4.1 Basic Meta-Model Package


NOTE
- This code is meant to provide a simple code base for reference.
- However, it is buggy and incomplete.
